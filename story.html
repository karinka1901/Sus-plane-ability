                To live in a space station, what an honour. Years ago you were selected among millions to be one of the
                few lucky individuals to take part in an experiment started by the World Government. As one of the chosen few you had
                the opportunity to look down upon Earth in all of it's glory. Months later you notice that the Earth no
                longer looks as it once did. As it turns out this was the reason behind this whole experiment.

                Earth doesn't have much more time. The polluted world you see before you is a product of the
                unsustainable lifestyle of humans. No one else on the space station shared your worries with the
                corruption taking over Earth. You knew you had to take action, even if you were alone. With your trusty
                space-made purification gun, and only a few minutes to spare you hijack an escape pod and make your way
                to Earth to purify the spreading pollution. Landing right outside of the airport, you come across an
                old airplane with limited co2 amount.

                Fly around to all the countries and purify Earth as you go. The fate of Earth is in your hands, however
                your fate is in hands of bored higher beings that like to throw dice. With enough luck you may be able
                to succeed.</div>
